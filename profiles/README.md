# Profiles

In order to avoid having duplicate code among the various hosts configurations,
some of their common configs will be placed here.

Note how there's also a `graphical/` and `server/` split, inspired on @RageKnify's
approach, in order to properly separate concerns (even though I currently do not
maintain any servers).
